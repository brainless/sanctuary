The source code for Sanctuary, a safe online space for anyone to share and support issues in mental health and well-being

## Introduction

A sacred and safe place for people who are in mentally stressful situations - living with psychological conditions like anxiety, depression, paranoia, stress disorder, attention issues or any other.

Simple rules like these could guide the sanctuary:

- Share only what you are going through, not what you feel about someone else
- Comment on someone's post only if you have something positive or supportive, anything else will be flagged and removed
- Posts/comments are always anonymous unless you set otherwise
- You have to login with an email only as a spam prevention mechanism
- Optionally, you can get a link to any posts/comments you create so you can come back later, but the system does NOT associate content with user
- Professinal counselors may join and help, only if they declare themselves as such, sharing proper credentials
- Rules guiding the system, except the ones about anonymity, can be decided by the community

All software behind Sanctuary will be open source, maintained on GitHub. Infrastructure will be run by donations from hosting companies. Sanctuary will be completely free to join and use.
